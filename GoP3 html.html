      <h2>Gameplay — Core Mechanics</h2>
      <p>GOP3 is built around layered tactical encounters, emergent sandbox mechanics and deep progression systems. Below you will find a thorough breakdown of the main systems and how they interact.</p>

      <article class="gameplay-subsection">
        <h3>1. Core Loop</h3>
        <p>The core gameplay loop in GOP3 involves exploration, resource gathering, strategic skirmishes, and base or character progression. Players explore hazardous environments to extract valuable resources, fight or avoid rival factions, and return to safe hubs to upgrade gear and plan their next move.</p>
        <p>Each loop iteration increases the player's options — unlocking gear, better tools, and improved faction reputation, which in turn open new mission types and story beats.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="gameplay-subsection">
        <h3>2. Movement and Controls</h3>
        <p>Movement is responsive and kinetic. The player can sprint, slide, climb, vault and perform tactical dodges. Environmental traversal is a core part of both exploration and combat encounters.</p>
        <p>Combat controls emphasize aim, positioning and ability timing. Abilities often have area effects and can synergize with the environment (explosive barrels, traps, destructible cover).</p>
      </article>

      <article class="gameplay-subsection">
        <h3>3. Combat Systems</h3>
        <p>Combat is a blend of ranged and melee mechanics with emphasis on situational awareness. Weapon variety matters — assault, precision, heavy, and experimental prototype gear change how a player approaches a fight.</p>
        <p>Enemies have AI behaviors like flanking, suppression, retreat, ambush and support calls. Knowing enemy patterns and choosing loadouts to counter them is crucial for higher-difficulty content.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="gameplay-subsection">
        <h3>4. Teamplay and Synergy</h3>
        <p>GOP3 features cooperative mechanics where players can synergize abilities. Some abilities provide buffs, shields or tactical vision. Coordination maximizes efficiency in objectives that scale enemy difficulty with player number and performance.</p>
        <p>Revive and support mechanics are balanced so teamwork is rewarded but solo play remains feasible for skilled players.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="gameplay-subsection">
        <h3>5. Progression Systems</h3>
        <p>Player progression is multi-faceted: experience for levels, unlockable abilities, gear with mods, and a reputation track with different factions. Unlocks often grant meaningful choice: powerful passives, unique equipment, or access to special missions.</p>
        <p>Progression is designed to encourage repeated loop play: new goals open up (elite missions, timed events, seasonal content) which keep the late-game experience engaging.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="gameplay-subsection">
        <h3>6. Resources and Economy</h3>
        <p>Resources come in several tiers: common crafting materials, rare upgrades and event-limited items. Market systems and trading between players can be present depending on the server or mod settings.</p>
        <p>Managing inventory and prioritizing extraction runs is a strategic layer that distinguishes veteran players from newcomers.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="gameplay-subsection">
        <h3>7. Mission Types</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Extraction missions:</strong> enter a zone, collect objectives, extract before timers or enemy reinforcement waves arrive.</li>
          <li><strong>Assault missions:</strong> heavy combat scenarios with multiple phases and strong bosses.</li>
          <li><strong>Stealth runs:</strong> high-reward sneaking objectives with limited detection mechanics.</li>
          <li><strong>Escort & defense:</strong> defend NPC convoys or bases while waves of enemies arrive.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article class="gameplay-subsection">
        <h3>8. Example Strategy Guide</h3>
        <p>For a balanced guild-style approach: combine a scout to recon and mark enemy positions, a heavy to hold choke points, and a support to provide heals and revives. Use the scout's speed to control engagements; force the enemy to fight on your terms.</p>
        <p>Loosely: prioritize position, control sightlines, disable high-value targets first (snipers and casters), and exploit environmental hazards. Weapon mods that reduce detection or increase mobility are often undervalued but can be decisive.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="gameplay-subsection">
        <h3>9. Difficulty Scaling & Reward</h3>
        <p>Difficulty in GOP3 scales with mission type and modifier choices selected by the players (such as "No respawns" or "Harder enemies but higher loot"). High-risk runs offer unique cosmetic and gear rewards; community events sometimes rotate these options.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="gameplay-subsection">
        <h3>10. Tips for New Players</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Learn movement — mobility often beats raw firepower in GOP3.</li>
          <li>Bring tools for extraction — leaving empty-handed wastes time.</li>
          <li>Prioritize upgrades that fit your playstyle — there is no single "best" build.</li>
          <li>Join a group early — coordinated teams clear harder content faster.</li>
          <li>Study enemy types — some are weak to specific damage types or statuses.</li>
        </ol>

      <h2>Game Lore & Setting</h2>
      <p>The world of GOP3 unfolds in a fragmented near-future setting where scarcity and factional control drive conflict. Explore the ruins of once-great cities, abandoned research laboratories and mist-shrouded industrial zones filled with secrets.</p>
      <p>Key themes: technological hubris, fractured societies, and cooperation vs survival. Faction ideologies shape available missions and provide narrative threads that tie gameplay loops together with story content.</p>

      <article>
        <h3>Main Factions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Consortium:</strong> corporate-minded, advanced tech but morally ambiguous.</li>
          <li><strong>Wild Coalition:</strong> improvised survivors who favor mobility and guerilla tactics.</li>
          <li><strong>Old Guard:</strong> militarized units protecting old world knowledge and artifacts.</li>
        </ul>

      <article>
        <h3>Story Hooks</h3>
        <p>Short campaign hooks and mission leads are scattered across the map as sidequests and faction contact missions, gradually revealing deeper lore as players complete high-level objectives.</p>
